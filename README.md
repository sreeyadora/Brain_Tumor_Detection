🧠 Brain Tumor Detection

A deep learning project that classifies MRI scans to detect brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

🚀 Features
- Loads MRI scan dataset and preprocesses images
- Trains a CNN model to classify brain tumor presence
- Evaluates performance on test data with accuracy metrics
- Predicts new MRI scans for quick inference

---

🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras – for building the CNN
- OpenCV – for image loading & preprocessing
- NumPy, Pandas – data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

---

🚀 How to Run

📥 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sreeyadora/Brain_Tumor_Detection.git
cd Brain_Tumor_Detection
````

🐍 Install dependencies

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

▶️ Train or test the model

```bash
python brain_tumor_detection.py
```

> ⚠️ Make sure the dataset is available in the expected directory or update the script paths accordingly.

📈 Expected Results

* Trains a CNN to achieve high classification accuracy
* Displays confusion matrix and sample predictions on MRI scans
* Saves the trained model for later inference

---

📝 Future Improvements

* Use data augmentation to improve generalization
* Implement more complex architectures like ResNet
* Build a web interface to upload & predict MRI scans in real-time
